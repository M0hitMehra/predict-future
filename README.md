# 🔮 Tomorrow-inator 3000 🔮

_I made a thing that tells you what day it is tomorrow. Revolutionary, I know._

## What even is this?

So basically I was bored and thought "wouldn't it be hilarious if I made the most over-the-top fortune teller ever... but it just tells you tomorrow's date?"

And here we are.

It's got a spinning crystal ball, floating ghosts, mystical runes, and enough sparkles to blind a unicorn. All to tell you something you could figure out by looking at literally any calendar.

## What it does

- Predicts tomorrow with **shocking accuracy** 🤯
- Shows you a crystal ball that does absolutely nothing useful but looks cool
- Throws sparkles everywhere because why not
- Makes dramatic predictions like "gravity will work tomorrow"
- Detects if it's gonna be Monday (spoiler: people will complain)
- Works on your phone, tablet, whatever

## The "predictions"

It'll tell you groundbreaking stuff like:

- "Your coffee will taste like coffee (unless it's tea)" ☕
- "You'll check your phone at least 47 times" 📱
- "Your socks will mysteriously disappear in the laundry" 🧦👻
- "The WiFi will work perfectly until you need it most" 📶💀

Basically all the obvious stuff that happens every day but presented like I'm some mystical oracle.

## How to use it

1. Go to the website
2. Click the big flashy button
3. Watch it do a dramatic 3-second "channeling cosmic forces" thing
4. Get your mind blown by tomorrow's date
5. Question your life choices

## Tech stuff

Made with basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No fancy frameworks, no AI, just good old-fashioned web development and way too much time spent on CSS animations.

The "mystical algorithms" are literally just `new Date()` but that doesn't sound as cool.

## Why did I make this?

Good question. I honestly don't know. Sometimes you just gotta build something completely ridiculous and put it on the internet.

Plus I wanted to practice CSS animations and got carried away with the sparkles.

## Can I steal this code?

Sure, go nuts. Just don't blame me when people question your sanity.

## Future plans

Maybe I'll add:

- Sound effects (if I can find royalty-free mystical whooshes)
- More ridiculous predictions
- A "premium" mode that predicts the day after tomorrow
- Integration with actual horoscope APIs for maximum chaos

Or maybe I'll just leave it as is. It's perfect in its absurdity.
